These adorable ASCII art bunnies will make your day!

***custom:***
From a selection of simple yet cute faces and arms, you can
craft your own bunny and make it pop into your screen. With
the bunnies comes a helpful page, which you can access via
typing in "custom help" that will guide you through many a
bunny. This program was the original Custom Bunny Maker,
but the first definitely isn't the worst!

***Bunny:***
This program, albeit simpler, still accomplishes much of the
same concepts as "custom." However, your selection is no
longer limited! You will be asked for eyes and arms of your
choice, and then the program will automatically generate a 
bunny to suit your needs. 

Enjoy!
